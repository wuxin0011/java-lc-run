/**
 * Represents a functional interface for defining an operation that can throw a checked exception.
 * This interface is designed to encapsulate code that performs an action but may throw an exception during execution.
 * It is annotated with {@code @FunctionalInterface}, indicating that it is intended to be used as a lambda expression
 * or method reference. The single abstract method {@code apply} defines the operation to be executed.
 *
 * This interface is particularly useful in scenarios where functional programming patterns are applied, and operations
 * that throw exceptions need to be handled in a structured manner.
 *
 * The {@code ThrowableFunction} interface is not generic and does not define any member properties. Its primary purpose
 * is to provide a type-safe way to handle operations that may throw exceptions, ensuring that such operations can be
 * integrated into functional workflows.

     * Executes the defined operation encapsulated by this functional interface.
     * This method contains the logic to perform an action that may potentially throw a checked exception.
     * It is intended to be implemented or referenced as part of a lambda expression or method reference
     * when using this interface in functional programming patterns.
     *
     * The {@code apply} method is the single abstract method of the {@code ThrowableFunction} interface,
     * making it central to the interface's purpose. It allows for the integration of exception-throwing
     * operations into functional workflows, ensuring that such operations can be handled in a structured manner.
     *
     * Implementations of this method should focus on performing the desired operation while declaring any
     * exceptions that may arise during execution. Callers of this method are responsible for handling
     * or propagating the declared exceptions appropriately.
     *
     * @throws Exception if an error occurs during the execution of the operation. The specific type of exception
     *                   thrown will depend on the implementation of the method and the nature of the operation.
